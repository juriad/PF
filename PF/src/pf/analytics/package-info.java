/**
 * Provides classes for all analytics calculations.
 * <p>
 * The main class is {@link pf.analytics.Point} which replaces {@link java.awt.Point} which is badly implemented. 
 *  {@link pf.analytics.Point} implements most methods of {@link java.awt.Point}.
 * <p>
 * Relations of  {@link pf.analytics.Point}s is represented by  {@link pf.analytics.Vector}.
 * <p>
 * The last piece is  {@link pf.analytics.Line}, which copies some of methods of {@link java.awt.geom.Line2D}.
 * <p>
 * This class also contains default implementations of these interfaces.
